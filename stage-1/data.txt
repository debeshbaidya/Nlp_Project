+ Easy to open package, tastes good, stays fresh after opening and not using all at once, does what it's advertised to do
- Player randomly goes into "repeat song" mode. Music vanishes from the player. Do not buy this junk.
+ Nice and excellenet performance!. I bought two more of these for gifts to my family members.
- Stay away from this seller "Salter". I ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there's an unexpected delay! I cancelled right away, after waiting for almost a month
- Cheap selector round mechanical thing............ it would be better if it was all flat like a nano
- I bought this for a far-sighted relative, but it didn't magnify enough, and was distractinly blurry, so the gift wasn't well received. I give this two thumbs down
- When I received the flashlight it was broken I have tried to contact Mark Golden in Delray, Florida, the place the flashlight was sent from, and have heard nothing back this week
+ Feeling very safe as a women travelling alone This hotel makes you feel very safe in a big city as Delhi is. The pickingup from the airport is reliable and very fast and comfortable. Rooms are big and clean. The best you can get for little money!
+ I bought this ipod for me and my aunt we loved it cause perfect for gym use. YOu can clip it and go.. !!
- I have 2 of them. One stop working after 1 month of use. It`s difficult to go from one menu to another and use it in general.
- worst experience. hangs so much and restart from scratch wasting your whole time. Unreliable. I have returned to amazone. Kashif
- Got this as a Christmas present for my daughter. After two months, it won't do anything, won't emergency rest, nothing.
- Don't buy this the 128Mb version is just about to be made available for just a few pounds more.
+ This player/ recorder, which was purchased for my wife, works exactly as advertised. My old player is starting to die, so I will probably buy another one of these units.
- The archos unit is very hard to operate and tech ser are not very helpful when you need them.
+ I haven't heard anything but great things from the young lady that got this for Christmas! She loves it and takes it everywhere.
+ We purchased this microphone for use at our church. It works perfectly, sounds great, and was a steal for 20 bucks!
+ Safety key was fine... except I purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size I was looking for. I took a chance at the size so my own fault
- when was this made the 1700 an 8 track holds more and it's HUUUUGE. go buy yourself a shuffle for 40$ more and it holds 64x the space
- I didn't like this MP3 player at all. It worked wll until 3 months later. I was shocked! Don't get this if u don't want to waste money.
+ Great sound, low listening fatigue. This does not over-accentuate low frequncies, so if you're looking for overly booming bass, this is not it. note that it's an "open" design, so that you will hear environmental noise pretty clearly - it will not keep outside noises out
+ Purchased item for daughter for Christmas. Delivery on time, product worked as avertised. She is very pleased with her present.
- This computer is one of the worst items I've ever had (I took it back in the first week of using it) It has a horrible screen AIM doesnt work at all Internet Browser is soooooooooooooo slow DON'T BUY IT!
- Great for a few months then died - do not buy.
- Now coming to CONS
- the device is very good but not the perfect device as it could have been.
- the look is similar to A7000 and the design is now old, all the A6000, A6000+, A7000 and K3 note are same design.
- also the back on K3 note is less rigid than one on A6000+
- SAR ratings are the highest on any device seen in recent times, its almost at the allowed limit.
- allowed limit in India is 1.6 w/kg and K3 note has 1.59 w/kg. very high.
- dont get this device if you talk a lot on your cell phone.
- i am quite suprised that no one talks about this
- there is no protection on glass like corning or dragontrail, the glass is hardned glass as per what customer support told me but its a finger print magnet and it does get scratched quite easily as i have seen on A7000. get a tempered glass of good quality
- The dolby atmos does not work with every music, i dont see any change in music when dolby is on or off.
- also the quality through headphones is not good. i tried it with different headphones.
- Vibe UI is not that good, it feels like a half baked version of android with missing features.
- for instance there is no option to edit lock screen or the notification lights depending on your choice. nothing 3rd party launcher or lightflow wont fix
- Battery and heating.
- well i would say 2 days is not enough but using both sims and wifi always on, i am seeing battery life is not that great.
- its decent but i would say that i am getting much higher battery life on my oneplus and when playing games, it does heat up a bit. dont get me wrong its not very hot but it does heat up to around 44 - 47C. the biggest issue for me is the screen heats up too and using device for call is hard then. dont expect it to run cool but it will not heat up a lot.
- RAM optimization needs rework, on first boot you will get around 950 mb but i have seen fore close of apps when multi tasking.
- its a issue with software and not hardware.
+ No such major problems observed yet
+ UI preinstalled apps are little awkward but you can easily unistall it.
+ Themes Should provide more options to download themes.
+ Heating a mobile with this much specs can heat a liitle. its not a issue becoz i know the facts
+ Overall its value for money product, FULLY PAISA VASOOL
+ Hi I bought this product on 8th July which was the 1st flash sale.
+ The phone seems to be fine and so are the features, only concern being the high SAR value. Also the Product was delivered on time.
+ The phone worked fine for the first 12 days. But then I noticed that the battery would drain within a few hours of charging and post that the battery just gave up.
+ Tried using another battery to switch the phone on and the phone works just fine.
+ I am surprised that Lenovo is providing such poor quality products and flipkart backing them up.
+ I will now have to either return the product to flipkart or search a Lenovo service station hoping for them to replace the battery.
+ This mostly will be my last purchase from flipkart and lenovo
+ Will update post my interaction with Lenovo service station.
+ Best phone in range of 9999 and awesome features .
+ Pros: Full HD Screen
+ Camera 13 MP with great Quality
+ Faster than any other phone
- ok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to it..also being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your ear....it becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches, being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought one...I no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his 360 also, and to this day he constantly has to say "hold up mi switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt" with the 360 controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your 360
+ That might be a little misleading -- the battle mechanics are almost exactly the same as those in the first game (heck, as in most of Nippon Ichi's games, though this series, I think, is the best of the lot). That part of the game absolutely delivers:- Great classes.- Good monsters, and a more consistent class sytem for them.- Excellent assortment of items.- Good variety of levels.However, as far as the story -- an area in which Hour of Darkness was solid -- this game falls on its face. The writing is iffy, the plot itself is contrived, the characters (while certainly amusing) are predictable, and it just leaves so much to be desired. If you're looking for a storyline you can get involved in, go back to the first game.If you're in it for the game-play, though, don't miss this one! With some class tweaks and a few added features, Cursed Memories is a worthy addition for those who simply want the monotonous level-up madness that some of us thrive on.Great 2D art mixed with fun environments, HILARIOUS quips and item descriptions, engaging fights and hundreds of hours (literally) of entertainment
- Have you played any of the games in the Doom series? How about Metroid Prime? Medal of Honor? Golden Eye? Well, then you've played Halo 2, also, because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same. I don't care how many times X-Box magazine (odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X-BOX game is the system's magazine.) calls it the greatest game of all time, I'd rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious.The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme, utterly mundane, unoriginal, boring and just all around unentertaining. The game-play is so generic that it's as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer, the music is cliche, the voice acting is flat, and Master Chief is just an all around retard.The weapons, oh boy, the weapons, again another lame aspect of the game. The alien's weapons are like something in the kid's "toy gun" section from Toys R Us, and the human guns are nothing that I haven't used in a Resident Evil game.When the first Halo came out I didn't get the big deal, I didn't even play it, then eventually I got myself an X-Box, and decided to give this installment a shot - huge mistake. Come to think of it none of the games of X-box are even worth owning a system for: Fable was decent, but got old after beating it a few times, The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring, and everything else on X-Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube
- Halo 1 on steroids, Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie's creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced game-play. A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense, and has no flow, along with levels that aren't replayable. You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious? Try the headache inducing map design in this game. Also in the nonsense, the unneccesary switch to an Elite's perspective for half the game, along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon. Apes with mohawks, yeah, nice design. I can only play one or two levels of the single player, and they are so noobish, it loses appeal quickly. On to Multiplayer. Okay, in 2004 upon release, this was a great game. It took time to go up in level, and the ranking system wasn't as abused as it is now. Once new maps, kept on the harddrive (read mod kids) were released by Bungie, that opened the door to full blown chaos. Now 2 years later, modding has died down somewhat, but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find a game with no lag. So I still play on occasion, it's lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice, choose servers with good connections, and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too. I only pray Halo 3's multiplayer improves on this system, otherwise I'm done with the Xbox console permanently
- Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.Main characters:Squall- A member of SeeD, he is a jerk to everybody.Zell-A member of SeeD, he is a surfer dude and a dunce.Quistis-A teacher and a member of SeeD, she seems to like Squall...for one reason or another...Seifer- Squall's rival, he is even worse then Squall.Rinoa- A member of 'The owls',Square soft ran out of ideas, she is just like Aeris.Selphie- A member of SeeD, she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts.Laguna- A Galbadian soldier. He is the best charecter in the game.Irvine-A member of SeeD, he is a lady's man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane.This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made. The story is great, but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable. If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP, I would buy it, but only if they removed the draw system
+ If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one! The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game. Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer, ninja, etc. much quicker. The main characters are still hilarious, and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl, Etna and the gang again in this one. (Go Prism Rangers =/).Once again the plot isn't too twisted, but it is enjoyable. Back to the game play though, its similar to the old one, but you have more options. For one, you can JOIN the Dark Assembly. In the item world you can not only level your item, but go to an assembly, improve the luck of your item, and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence the assembly. There is also the new addition of the subpoena. These are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders, too much hp etc. etc. These are "medals of honor" in the demon world, and allow your characters more prestige, not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world. Another bonus, you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item, so you can get a felony charge, and level your item at the same time.This game is a fabulous addition to any gamer's collection, and I highly recommend it! Enjoy
+ I am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original Disgaea. As such I will not get to much into the aspect of game-play and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note. Having said that, let's begin.The game begins in the land of Veldime, an alternate world from that of the first game, where an evil Overlord named Zenon has hidden from well, everyone. When he came into Veldime however, he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons. The effects weren't all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon, there will be no turning back. Thus the hero Adell (oddly enough the only person unaffected by Zenon's curse) sets out to defeat the Overlord. In the opening there is an attempt to summon Zenon to Adell so he can fight him, but it goes awry and Zenon's daughter accidentally gets summoned instead. Bound to Adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father (albeit not without scheming a bit herself). In a nutshell, the story is good. Nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original.The only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do Stack Attacks and, if you are quick enough, throw diagnally. The basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command, the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack. In doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground. Essentially, a team attack of up to 10 characters. There have been updates to the Dark Assembly with 6 factions of Senators being introduced. And it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk (random vote basically) or even asleep (no vote at all). Perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies. You can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling, having to much hp/so/mana, or even killing your own allies. The benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get, it is easier to pass proposals at the Dark Assembly, and for every felony on a character they gain 1% extra exp. This works all the way up to 300 felonies (300% exp bonus).The game has made all the necessary additions to make the game-play top that of the original, however in my opinion there feels like something is missing. The characters seem a bit more "by the book" and not as wonderfully absurd as the original. That and the voice acting isn't quite as good as the that of the first Disgaea (plus Etna has a new voice actress...). Despite all of that however, the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot. All in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game. While some may like the changes in the characters and others may not, there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long, if not longer
- This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced. I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card. Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed. Tried it with the other disc, failed again. Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them. Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund
- Don't buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer. I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy, but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need(ed) for my DVD burner. Check the search engines and see for yourself. Would have otherwise been a great game, too bad it isn't playable because of this malware
- Starforce....nothing else need be said. Starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of "could be" great games...I don't know since not a single one will play on a Dell XPS "Gaming" Laptop
- I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun. I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice. It would not run. I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run. When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system. In short, if you have an "over the counter" system, you cannot run this game on your computer. I find this ridiculous and disappointing. I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play. Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box
- This game sucks. It tries to be Sim City with extra features. Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average. In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student. The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive. I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short
+ I bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact I haven't heard any noise he is to busy playing it
+ Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off (aside PSP's Crisis Core), and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world. The game seems like a must-play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike, and it is. Thinking, most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs, this game is relatively easier than popular FPS (shooters) like Halo. Being an RPG-fan, yet still wanting to learn the story of the game, I was very happy for the easy difficulty (though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode.) The controls are a little bad, but nothing that someone can't get used to. For one of Square's second or third shooter games, this one is pretty good.I'd recommend if you're doing what I did and playing it for story, then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go (which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them, you never have to get them again). The guide is actually pretty good for this game, as well as the soundtrack. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy music, definitely pick the soundtrack up.Lastly, if you're a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan, get this game and everything related to it. It's worth it. I couldn't put this game down, even if some characters are a bit under-developed.If you're a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed
- This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear
+ This controller feels great in your hands. In fact, after using this controller for awhile, my batteries went low and I had to switch back to the Dualshock controller. The Dualshock felt wierd in my hands. The response of the controller is good. I have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time. One down side to the controller was that I returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time. I guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year
- I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier. I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box. I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work. I hoped it would get better but it only got worse. I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away.I would NEVER recommend this product.
- I know that Pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they're always the cheapest ones available. That should tell you something.First of all, the top screen uses adhesive. It's smooth plastic in the middle, but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen. Because the edge is a different material than the middle, it's insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it, and being adhesive, trying again and again isn't much of an option. Furthermore, the sticky edge is white, not clear, and it looks horrible on my onyx DS Lite.After having so much difficulty with the top screen protector, I checked online for reviews. I read several reports of people who used the Pelican styluses with the Pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour's worth of use. So, whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus, the combination just doesn't work.Many people report simply throwing their Pelican Write and Protect sets into the trash, so I'm not the only one that paid Pelican money for something that's going into the trash can. No matter how inexpensive Pelican's product is, it's still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too.I know I'm going to avoid the Pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future, and I very much wish that there were reviews here on Amazon before I bought mine. I had to dig through Nintendo DS forums to read other peoples' opinions.Finally, if you already bought one and hate it, you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue
- This is Supposed to be an x-box cleaner, but the system does not read the disc. A shoddy product
- the grain was terrible. next time i set it at 100 and used the flash.
- well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise.
+ when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome.
+ i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images.
- the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash.
- relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots.
+ contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon.
- now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
+ what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware.
- the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software.
- what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical. what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it.
+ i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision.
+ this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well.
+ my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time.
+ manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding. i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck.
+ the service from the supplier was exceptional. the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition.
+ by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced.
- about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder.this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler.
+ i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
+ the light auto-correction is awesome.
+ you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
- the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds.
- got way too many blurry pictures. i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
+ 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras ,
+ 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera.
+ it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features.
- the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots.
- it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button.
- it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot.
- unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted.
+ this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier.
+ i love the quality of the pictures. they look fantastic. 
- Aggressively dull and terribly paced.
- With just a few script tweaks, this long, dull and downright bizarre bore-a-thon could have been more aptly named Uranus Numbing.
- The film is deeply cynical about its special effects, which are employed to deter us from the poor script and performances.
+ It's big. It's goofy. It's highly imaginative. It has a little something on its mind. And it's fun.
+ A compelling, rousing and at times strangely moving entertainment.
+ A brutally intelligent political thriller...
+ The explosive V for Vendetta is powered by ideas that are not computer-generated. It's something rare in Teflon Hollywood: a movie that sticks with you.
+ Excellent Movie, Best message and a peak of what may be a visible future for America.
+ Possibly the best film of the year by far, a true achievement in enthralling storytelling and a cast which delivered some of their best individual performances yet.
+ V for Vendetta is a milestone. Maybe not a big marker, but a milestone nonetheless
- In its ambition to weld a political message onto a comic-book movie it falls rather pitifully between two stools.
- Movie was awful. If you have people you cant stand, suggest this movie to them
- V for Vendetta is a dud - far too long at nearly two and a half hours, with flat, grungy visuals, choppy editing and no sense of urgency.
- V for Very Very Bad Film - As a fan of the comic, my opinion might be considered biased, but the FIVE people I took with me to the cinema had never heard of Alan Moore or V for Vendetta and we all roundly thought that this film was utterly rubbish.
+ Gladiator is a triumph. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with strong, rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills.
+ Gladiator knows its audience wants blood, and it's all too happy to provide it. But as long as you don't come looking for more, it's a satisfying spectacle, in every sense of the word.
+ Glorious, a colossus of rousing action and ferocious fun.
+ It's a stunning Roman triumph.
+ To this day I still think this is the best movie that has ever been made, I love this film.
+ It lives up to the hype. Gladiator has its creaky moments, but it delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.
+ Quite a good movie--a big, fat, rousing, intelligent, daring, retro, many-adjective-requiring entertainment.
- For all its grandeur, Gladiator is a canned experience, a film that flails around awkwardly trying to find a reason to exist, or at least a compelling story to tell.
- The soul of Gladiator is made sluggish by a maddening lack of suspense
- Time for a little gladiatorial gore with your Milk Duds. Gladiator is here, and it's big, glorious and eminently dumb.
+ A must-see — and one of the best films of the year
+ Me and Earl and The Dying Girl is a film that shows that behind the director, there is a new voice with a lot of talent
+ Me and Earl & the Dying Girl is a superb tearjerker that skilfully captures the vulnerability that comes with intimacy and the bittersweet inevitability of life and death.
+ Your new favorite export from the Sundance-industrial complex glows with the heat of festival awards, standing ovations, and distributor bidding wars.
+ It relies on smart writing, clever ideas, terrific cinematography and rich, complex characters who are inhabited by three superb young actors, as well as a cast of crafty veterans in the supporting roles.
+ His film is at once buzzy, fun and confronting.
+ This movie is a highly original masterpiece
- This largely casual coming of age story doesn't adequately prepare the way for big drama and emotion, which consequently comes off falsely.
- Undone by a wildly inconsistent tone, narrative devices that rotate between incongruous cuteness and bald-faced lying, and a protagonist who's just a horrendous, despicable character.
- A pandering, self-flattering mess, featuring unearned catharsis, lazy clichés and characters presented in broad, sometimes-offensive stereotypes.
+ With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since "Pulp Fiction."
+ It's not enough to say that Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. It's the first movie of his artistic maturity, the film his talent has been promising for more than 15 years.
+ This is one in a long line of classics by Tarrantino. It is a cinematic masterpiece.
+ A smart, sophisticated and perplexing blend of wisdom and attitude that takes bold risks, sneers at convention and then still has enough audacity to rewrite the history books for one last daring climax.
+ The intricate plot offers a wealth of opportunities for scene-stopping showpieces of all kinds, from epic spectacle to intimate character work.
+ The dialogue is fabulous.
- A failure so complete that it is infuriating as opposed to merely disappointing
- Tarantino is loosing his touch. Very dull, so very dull.
- A movie that encapsulates all that is vulgar, stupid and repellent about the Hollywood mind-set.
- It's bad, very very bad, but in its own goofy, retarded way, it can be oddly compelling.
- Kangaroo Jack falls flat more than it bounces.
- I'm sorry to say that Kangaroo Jack is top of my 2003 'worst list' so far.
- I felt the same misery, despair, offense and nausea while watching this film as I did The Cat in the Hat.
- The story is bland and workmanlike--week-old catnip that's lost its bite.
- Garfield remains one of the most shamelessly marketed properties of all time.
+ A childhood favourite and a classic!
- Hewitt's movie isn't without its laughs but it's ultimately a pretty pointless picture.
- A motion picture so ungainly and awful that only an under-8 child could appreciate it.
- a film without energy and without spirit.
- If you're a fan of Garfield, then I suggest you stay away from the fat cat's big screen debut.
- This film should never have been made, and those involved with its production likely know it.
- A soulless and empty movie based on a three-panel comic strip.
+ The film has a solid grasp on the mutable, but ever-present pain of loss.
+ The line between terrifying reality and terrifying fantasy isn't so much blurred as altogether obliterated.
+ This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times.
+ It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody.
+ At its heart, "The Babadook" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying.
+ In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane
+ The Babadook, one of the best and most original horror films in years, raises goosebumps with old-fashioned scares, relatable characters, and a provocative psychological foundation.
+ The Babadook doesn't just introduce a new horror classic to audiences. It also marks the assured feature debut of Jennifer Kent.
- The Babadook makes a convincing argument for classy, psychological horror cinema even as it fails to meet its own lofty standard.
- The film strives for horror in the way of The Shining or Silence of the Lambs, but it's more like Annabelle with better cinematography, which isn't a compliment.
+ Oculus is about one adjustment away from being a superior thriller.
+ Praised on the festival circuit, it's got what it takes to succeed outside of that rarefied atmosphere.
- What's missing? A sense of the ineffable.
+ Oculus, a cleverer-than-average haunted-house movie... speaks to a couple of widespread anxieties-one topical, the other sadly timeless.
+ Good script, strong cast, several quality scares... yeah, it's actually a decent haunted mirror movie!
+ I think I'm the only person I know who drinks caffeine to relax before bed. It makes me sleepy. This helps my insomnia. The taste is wonderful, smooth, and for being a new coffee-drinker, it's been a pleasure!
+ I buy a lot of Eight O'Clock Coffee - kind of grew up with it. Not saying it is the best, but for price, favor and delivery convenience - can't beat the price from Amazon. Hope this helps.
+ Anytime is hummus time, at least since I got a case by Fantastic Foods. Here's some of what all I love about itTakes only scant minutes to prepare. I don't have to plan my hummus, it can be spur of the moment.It's blended well and smooth every time because it comes that way. The flavor is delicious and can stand alone, although I enjoy adding this or that like chopped onions, more garlic powder, roasted or raw red pepper, etc.Good in so many ways! I enjoy eating it as a chip dip, cracker dip, veggie dip, sandwich spread, sandwich pocket filling, any way I have stuff on hand for. By itself is good too.Yes there is lemon in there, it's great! I didn't find this too salty, at least no more salty than Sabra for example.
+ Just finished a case and ordering another. Gluten and Dairy free, for starters. Shelf stable, so I make what I need, and you can just make half of the box if you measure it out. I put some sundried tomatoes in my food processor first, then add the hummus, water and olive oil. Started experimenting with other add-ins based on supermarket flavors. No one I have served this to even hesitates to eat it, and no one knows it's from a box!
+ Not too garlicy,Quick, easy preparation,Buy in advance, no refrigeration until you make it!As a longtime vegetarian, I am hooked on this product, and lots of raw carrots.
+ The Hummus is my favorite product from Fantastic World Foods. It is really delicious and it can be used so many ways. I like to add some to my Falafel sandwiches but I also use it as a dip for almost everything.
+ Wow - great Hummus, much better than one could expect from a dry-powder. Once you spice it up a bit with some red paprika, a bit of parsley and some cumin - its nearly the best Hummus I have ever had - and I had Hummus at the best places in Israel and New York City.
+ I received this order in a timely fashion. I immediately made one box of the mix, the powdered mix smelled pretty strongly of concentrated lemon flavor. However, after I added the water and oil, the odor disappeared. I added 1 clove of crushed garlic and some Cayenne Pepper. The mix is very tasty, very similar to "real" Hummus. It does not have a strong and artificial lemon flavor, indeed, I added a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice. I have eaten Hummus for a very long time, I would never have guessed that this was made from a dried mix. Next time I will use 2 boxes of mix at once. It is very good and and 1 batch will not go far. I can highly recommend this to Hummus aficionados everywhere.
+ I've been using this product for at least 20-25 years, maybe longer -- and never even noticed that it was "too" lemon-y! I just loved the blend of ALL its flavors. I now live in an area with only two health food stores located some distance from me -- both carry this hummus but it's a long drive. A large midwest grocery chain (Meijers) that's 20 minutes away sometimes carries it but has been phasing out Fantastic in favor of Annies (who pays the store more "kickback" for greater shelf space -- bah). So, I've been without any hummus for about 4 weeks at this point and was delighted to find it on amazon. Now as blizzards, etc near, I won't have to worry about being without it again!Update since I wrote the above review I ordered the 12-pack currently on sale for $28.50. I didn't look closely enough at the seller however. I assumed it was Amazon and that I'd get free shipping. But it's an outside firm. I checked their confusing shipping pop-up page, which lists cost pe...
+ I was pleasantly surprised at the full, rich taste of this cocoa. Mix in a tablespoon with a 1/2 cup low-fat or skim Ricotta cheese, crushed raspberries, and walnuts for an excellent low-fat to no fat dessert. Better than ice cream! Or add 1 tbsp of organic chunky almond butter(without sugar; Stevia, to taste, is great instead)to the Ricotta cheese, and cocoa. Also great if you're on the HCG program, phase 1, mix in 1 tsp with your coffee; or sprinkle on strawberries or oranges and mix the cocoa with the fruit's natural juice. <a href="http//www.amazon.com/gp/product/BM0G2Q8">Wonderslim Pure Fat-Free Cocoa Powder, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a>
+ Not much beyond the review title to say...this stuff makes great hot cocoa. It tastes decidedly more decadent than a pure fat-free cocoa powder should... But I'll take it!
+ Apparently it's the fat in cocoa that keeps it from disolving easily. This disolves very easily. I got it because it was fat free. I'm staying with it because it disolves so incredibly easily, and I can't notice any loss in flavor at all. It's what cocoa should be.
+ i first bought this product in a health-food store the rainy winter i lived in hawaii because i was attracted to the delightful, old-fashioned can. i have since come to love this product, and i buy it regularly, because it is decaf and fat free, two things i value. on any given cold night, it sends me off to sleep very nicely. because it is virtually without caffeine and fat, it is not as rich as other brands of cocoa, and purists may object to this, but i don't. i've been drinking for so many years now that hershey's, for example, tastes too sweet. i put it in a deep mug, add steaming hot milk, whisk it to a froth, and enjoy it. so should you.
+ item is awesome, my only disappointment is that cans were dented and cocoa dust was all in bag- not a product that could be return- so not a product issue a shipping
+ De-caf, fat free, nearly carb free, delicious. What more could you want? I drink it in skim milk with a tiny bit of sacharin added for sweetness for a low carb, no sugar treat. Highly recommended!!!!
+ I really like baking with this product. However, the packaging is awful. Every time I open up the can, I get it all over the place.
+ This stuff is so hard to find! For those of us that don't use caffeine but still enjoy chocolate baked goods, this is a real blessing. It tastes just like cocoa, just no caffeine. Why have the caffiene if all you want is chocolate!
+ I make hot cocoa almost every morning, heating milk and mixing it with cocoa powder and sugar. I used to use Droste, but the flavor wasn't consistent from box to box, and it was often hard to find. This cocoa is the best, love how it dissolves and the rich flavor.
+ I just can't beleive they charge $46 for 3 packs. I buy the same exact product at my local vitamin store and guess what? it is $6 per can!!!!
+ I love this cocoa powder. Found it first at Bob's Red Mill and then here on Amazon for less. I use this several times a week for Peanut Butter and Chocolate Protein Shakes. Super Yummy! I also love that it's almost caffeine free, because I'm sensitive to some chocolates and caffeine.
+ This is real cocoa for real people. We can't tell the difference between full fat stuff from the grocery store and the Wonderslim in our banana "ice cream".
+ These are great! The perfect bite size pie for a small treat. Just like any food, they don't look like the picture on the box. Also, if you are looking for an "American type" apple pie, these are not for you. It is an apple pie, minus the cinnamon.We like them. The crust is good, and the filling is good.
+ Very Cute Lollipops. I bought these Lollipops for my daughter's 3rd Birthday...I had a sweets table with all different kinds of lollipops that the kids got to pick from at the end of the party and take home. These were very cute and this was just the kind of lollipop I had in mind for my table, so I was excited to find them. The kids loved them.
+ Loved these pops... yes they had to be rewrapped but they were perfect for part of a baby shower favor ... the colors were beautiful... and the pops were very affordable ...
+ These were a hit at my 3 year olds party, dessert table! I read the reviews so knew ahead that I would have to remove wrapper. It was, like stated, covered with black writing but I took scissors and snipped the plastic right off, it took me 15 mins for all of them. They were the perfect size for the 2-4 year olds, and were adorable. Would definitely buy again!!
+ I ordered these lollipops to go on top of a cake for a baby shower. The color and size were perfect,they were exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I changed was the wrapping on the lollipops, the ones that were on them had black writing on it, I just switched with clear cellophane bags.
+ These lollipops taste very good. I really didn't mind the black writing on the wrapper because i bought them to eat them not for the wrapper. But yeah there is writing on the wrapper. They are also smaller than what the picture looks like. Overall these are good tasting. My roommate and I love them.
+ I was very pleased with my order of the Lake Grassmer Sea Salt. The product is terrific, very tasty. But what really impressed me was the wonderful way it was packed by the seller and the very very fast shipping. I would recommend this product and seller to everyone. I will be ordering from them again.
+ If you think that salt is merely salt, listen up! This salt gives a flavor to food that youwould have never imagined. Salt is a flavor enhancer, but this salt tastes like the RollsRoyce of them all. If you want to savor your cooking and kick it up a notch or two, I recommendsprinkling this salt on just about anything you can put in your mouth. BRAVO!
+ Delicious flavor enhancer. I will never go back to kosher salt again. It is very mild, without any "biting" aftertaste...a staple in my cabinet from now on.
+ If you are a curry lover, chutney is a "must have" to go along with it. I had never heard of this label before but I'm very pleased with the quality.
+ Eat slowly, let small bites melt on your tongue. You will get different flavors and tastes. Although expensive, you don't need to eat a lot to satisfy your chocolate craving. I can take 4 days for 1 3 oz bar. Certainly as good as any Belgian or Swiss chocolates I bought in Europe from gourmet chocolate stores. Sadly, not well known in the US. The original company was bought by Hershey a few years ago, but does not advertise Sharffen Berger as much as their other candies. Which is surprising, given that this is so much better than the Hershey bars, kisses, etc for eating or cooking. So buy a bar, taste a bit of chocolate heaven. BTW, this is specifically for the dark chocolate, but their bittersweet is also excellent. I don't eat milk chocolate any more, but my daughter loves their milk chocolate, says its the best, and she has sampled a lot of chocolate.
+ For me this is the BEST tasting and top quality Chocolate. Not too sweet and not bitter. Can satisfy any chocolate cravings with just a small wedge.
+ The age of the 2-cent coffee filter is over. The Target near me no longer stocks a pack of coffee filters for $3.99. Ditto for Walgreen's where I nearly dislocated a shoulder reaching way to the back of the shelf for the last $1.99 package of filters. The best price I could find locally was filters for about five bucks. Sorry, no deal, not gonna pay it.As I was reaching for a can of the <a href="http//www.amazon.com/gp/product/BRTU">San Marzano plum tomatoes</a> I had ordered by the case from Amazon.com, I wondered Do they have a similar deal on coffee filters?Boy, do they! So what if they're a cent and a half more? They're still a better buy than any supermarket or drug store package. All of the packaging is recyclable, including the shipping box. And having them come right to the door is as good as a flavor shot. When I get down to the last box, I just order up another case.I couldn't really taste any difference ...
+ I've always been very particular about my coffee and I'm sorry I didn't begin using these filters earlier. With your first cup, you'll immediately notice a delightful difference. Unlike the inexpensive bulk coffee filters I bought for years, these natural filters allow the coffee to drain a little faster. If your ear is tuned to your coffee maker, you'll notice a difference in the drip sound straight away. The faster drain means the water does not linger and thereby pick up unpleasant oil and acid. The verdict Your coffee is served hotter and tastes far more mellow.Two things to note. 1) If you're using a cheap coffee maker that gives your coffee a metallic taste, I'm not sure how these will make a difference. (I use a Cuisinart and I love it.) 2) A medium grind works best. If you use a fine grind, you might find a bit of it in the bottom of the pot. Still the same, the coffee tastes so much better, it's worth the extra clean up.
+ before you buy coffee filters do your research. what chemicals do they use when making the paper? what glues do they use to hold the paper together? if you care rates superior in all categories in my book. if you don't care go ahead and drink something that is just been soaking in hundred degree water with acidic coffee. I think that's crazy if you're a health-conscious long-term coffee drinker. also drink organic coffee with fair trade certification
+ I chose this product because of the price and because they are unbleached. I was surprised and pleased at the quality of the product. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
+ We are really happy with these and knowing they are much more healthy than the treated ones. And Amazon had a great deal on them, so that's great too!
+ Good filters. A carton of 12 is a lot of filters, but the price per box is very good. I used to buy unbleached filters at my warehouse store, but I've moved and the local warehouse stores here only carry the white ones. I will purchase these again.
+ I haven't had to buy coffee filters for a while. I love them, the price is good, and they work great in my Melita single cup coffe maker as well as my twelve cup machine.
+ We go through alot of coffee in our household so I find it practical to stock up on these since they are a good price when purchased in bulk. We were using the Melitta filters before I bought these. I was looking for some filters that would reduce the amount of chemicals we were exposed to and still be cost effective. These filters satisfy my requirements and seem to be good quality so far. The sizing is accurate and work great in my Technivorm. I plan on purchasing more in the future providing the price is affordable.
+ Gold mesh filters, or the Melita paper filters with holes in them, release BAD heart un-healthy cafestol (raises bad cholesterol) into the coffee (sediment also upsets my stomach!)!-" Cafestol, found in coffee, "is the most potent dietary cholesterol-elevating agent known".Fortunately-- these paper filters remove the cafestol!See[...]Ricketts ML et al. The cholesterol-raising factor in coffee beans, cafestol, as an agonist for the farnesoid and pregnance X receptor. Molecular Endocrinology 21(July); 3-6."
+ Used to be a very funny TV commercial for a local Chicago furniture store. A vulgar woman proudly pointing to her bronze wall decoration of sculptured leaves, and loudly declaring "These . . . ARE LEAVES!" I am reminded of this as I submit my review. These are coffee filters. They filter coffee. I like the price, and the quantity, which means I'm unlikely to get out of bed and be surprised by being out of filters. A medical issue required me to stop using a permanent gold filter, so I'm happy to have an option using unbleached paper. However, these are shipped from Germany, so I'm really not convinced it is a huge favor to the environment to use them. I will keep buying them, however, because for now, all things considered, this seems like the way to go.
+ I'm going to try these coffee filters right away. It's amazing what they use to make coffee filters these days. As per description above IngredientsMalt, Yeast, kosher salt, organic white rye flour, organic dark rye flour, sourdough starter, enriched, unbromated, unbleached flour, water!!
+ I can't recall exactly what flavors go into the Jamaican Me Crazy coffee, but it is absolutely wonderful. It's one of my favorite pod flavors, and I order it regularly. I use a single pod with the single cup setting because I like my coffee good and strong. Add a single packet of Splenda, and I'm good to go. A delicious calorie-free treat for the morning to get my day started on the right foot!
+ Tasting these truffles is like being in heaven. So smooth and luxurious. I bought these on a whim and hopefully I can find them again. The taste of Rum is really pronounced. The really good thing is that four pieces is only calories.
+ This is excellent beef jerky. The taste is wonderful - I really get a great pure meat taste when I eat it. It's softer and more moist than most beef jerkys. It's hormone & antibiotic free which is fantastic. After eating this kind why would I eat other beef jerky that has hormones & antibiotics in it? Also the sodium level is less than other jerkys which is also a huge plus. And I'm trying to eat more protein cause I work out a lot and this really helps with that because it's loaded with protein. I can't wait to try the other flavors.
+ Got these when they were a Today's Deal. Jerky isn't something I normally purchase but if I did I'd get these. Much more tasty and tender than the ultra-chewy stuff I remember. Bits of jerked beef are small - largest about 1" x 1" - and a lot of crumb size bits too. Quality seemed good - no odd bits in 4 packs I've gone through and consistent otherwise for taste and texture. For me I'd gave it 4 stars with just -1 for the regular cost of the smallish 4oz bag which would keep me from buying again.
+ Nice smoky taste, which I like. I am having a hard time eating enough protein, so I thought this might help. It is soft (as commented on in other reviews), not the traditional pull with your teeth kind of jerky. I will be making a few concoctions with it - chopped in a bean salad, and crumbled on a baked potato.Thanks Amazon for the gold box special so that I could try it.
+ Meat was very moist. Not like most other type beef jerky that I tried. Not to my taste but it did have fast shipping.
+ It's tasty jerky, healthy, no msg, no nitrates, yada yada yada, but it has a certain powderiness to it, the source of which I haven't yet figured out. 4 stars.
+ First of all, we love jerky this is a much softer jerky than the traditional jerky we purchase but it also is natural. One huge benefit, the sodium level is under mg which for jerky is about mg less than what we normally purchase. Great item, but I will admit natural jerky won't taste like traditional. It is good just not the same...
+ Great tasting jerky, while the family likes the more traditional jerky I really have come to enjoy this hormone free jerky. The sodium level is so much lower than most jerky brands so not brutal salt like most jerky.
+ I love this stuff! Wild Ride Kickin' Teriyaki (Hormone & Antibiotic Free) has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gr...

+ I love Mamba Fruit Chews and they are not always easy to come by. I joined the Subscribe and Save option and got an excellent deal on these yummy treats. Each bag contains a variety of individually wrapped Mamba candies so you can grab one or a handful. Now we always have a little snack while we watch our favorite movies!
+ I am a Pu-Erh Tu Cha addict! When Amazon stopped carrying the Rishi brand, I ordered this. It isn't the same! This is a loose leaf tea. For some reason there are a lot of stems/twigs in the mix. Last I checked I was looking for full leaf! If you can get it, do try the Rishi brand. The Tu Cha is a bowl tea & it is individually wrapped in little bowl shapes inside a canister. What I do like about the Serendipitea brand is the packaging. Inside the cardboard box is a d paper bag that you can re-close by folding it over & closing the side tabs. Very environmentally friendly!Pu-Erh is a very intense full bodied tea. It brews black. Yes, I know it's black tea...but Pu-Erh brews black like coffee. It is black & potent! It tastes fantastic with honey or sugar and half & half. It is intense, no one would think that was tea in your mug! You are supposed to be able to brew it several times. I have tried this, but I like the super duper intensity & only use i...
+ Evaporated Cane Juice is better for you than sugar. And this can be substituted for sugar 11. However much sugar you use, use the same amount of this.As for the price, keep in mind that you can go to Trader Joe's any day of the week and buy a 2 lb bag of this for $2.99. If you were to buy this same amount of Florida Crystals Natural Sugar (evaporated cane juice) in Trader Joe's, you'd spend a total of $17.94.So unless the price on Amazon dips below $17.94 or you don't have Trader Joe's in your area or you need to add this to your order to reduce shipping because you don't have Prime, then you're probably spending a little more than you need to.
+ I've bought this sugar several times in the past and was very pleased with it. The flavor was great and I love how it's natural.
+ In an attempt to be healthier - we've cut out all the white in our home. We do like sweetened coffee in the morning and my husband has fallen in love with this Demerara sugar. It has a delicious taste to it and it's become the only sugar in our home. Amazon has a reasonable price on the bulk bags and the delivery is so convenient - so I happily purchase it here.
+ I really like these, I used to eat them as a little kid. I've never cared for the white ones, but The chocolate ones are the best.
+ I was amazed that I found out these have been around for over years, kinda makes you realize these will probably be around forever then. I use to eat these as a kid and still do on occasion. The assorted flavors are interesting and honestly, I don't think even after 10 years in storage the taste would be any different. If you havn't tried them yet you should and if you had them but not in a while, try them again.
+ I used to eat these all the time as a kid, and even into my 20's. There is only one flavor that I don't really care for, but I can still eat a whole package of these without even thinking about it. It's hard to believe they've been around for so long.
+ Neccos disappeared so gradually from retail stores that it was a while before I realized they were truly gone, and I'd have to buy them over the Internet. What a shame--I still have an occasional craving for them and just have to have them!My favorites were the old lavender (clove) ones. Where else can you get clove flavored candy? When I received my order, I thought they had discontinued that flavor, since I saw only white, pink, pale grey, yellow, brown, and orange. It turns out that the new, reformulated lavenders are so pale in color that they are almost indistiguishable from white, even in bright light. They taste much the same, though--yum!Chocolate, the most popular flavor, is noticably different now. It has a stronger chocolate taste, and I think it's an improvement, but if you loved the original, you may be disappointed that the taste has changed.Green (lime) has been discontinued--a shame, since it was my second favorite.
+ More caffeine than most energy drinks with vitamin c and only 20 calories per can! Its not as carbonated as alot of energy drinks, its more like a juice..of which it actually contains multiple types of fruit juices. Just don't buy them anywhere that is selling them for over a buck if you have a dollar tree store around. They carry them at ours and for only a buck a piece you just can't beat it.
+ If you are tired of spending $3-$4 for a can of Red Bull, this is a good alternative. The low carb version has a scant 20 calories per can (it says 10 calories, but its 2 servings per can, and who drinks half a can?). The only downside is that you can't find this as a good deal on the internet. At my local grocery store I pick them up for $1 a piece, and the internet sales for them is usually double that. The taste is on par with any other energy drink out there in my opinion making it the best value out there I have found.
+ I've tried several different kinds of energy drink - and can't stand the taste of most of them. This one I really like. It's a bit fruity (mango and pear and apple and peach) and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste of so many others. It's sweetened with Sucralose, and packs just 20 calories, plus several standard energy ingredients (taurine, ginseng, caffeine, guarana extract, etc.)It's a bit pricey here on Amazon - every vendor I've seen offers it for over two bucks a can when I can find it at my local gas station for about a buck and a half.
+ flackers taste great! texture very satisfying...great with guacamole, humis! yea! finally a cracker that's great protein with little carb...carbs like in vegies! not as in bread! love them!
+ My cats love this stuff! I like the size; no leftovers. This is the only Urinary care canned cat food I can find without paying a fortune at the Vets office.
+ This was recommended to me by my long-time vet after my 5 year old Russian Blue boy developed chrystals in hir urine and was hospitalized. She also recommedned the canned food she has in her office but my ctas wouldn't eat it. I saw this stuff at Petco and gave it a try. Now, they share a can every day and no more trips to the vet. Phew!!!
+ the only food my cat will actually eat, he needs urinary tract all the time and refuses to eat the other precription brands
+ my cat loves this first time I have found a cat food that he will eat and every time i go in the kitchen he thinksits time to eat
+ What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater? I've never met any. My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat. Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both the Beef in Gravy or Tuna. Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods. If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in the garden. Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container. (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!) Pouches are easy to dispose of too. Just rinse and trash. You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.
+ This Cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product. Every time I open the pouch, my cat will come wanting to eat it. Please try this product with your cat if you have not done so yet. It is good for cats that are picky eaters.
+ My cat will only eat the Whiskas Choice cuts with beef. My local stores quit carrying this product and I bought any cat food similar to it, regardles of price. My cat ate only dry food for two months or more. He lost weight that he can't afford to lose. I am so happy that I found this Whiskas item on Amazon.
+ It is hard to get just one falvor of this product. I was very happy to order 48 pouches. However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don't receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments.
+ Another popular seafood flavor that Sophie and Samson won't share. When I bend down to place their bowls in front of them, they are on their back legs trying to get to it before I can put the bowl on the floor. They act like they have not been fed in days. Nothing will disturb them - not even their favorite UPS man who brings them treats. Can't beat Amazon prices !!!
+ Every day is Thanksgiving at Sophie and Sam's dinner mat when they receive their Whiskas Turkey and Giblets in gravy. They are quick to devour it and clean each other right after eating (I know they hope to pick up a piece hidden in the fur!). I only buy from Amazon because of their awesome prices!
+ Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor. My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone. When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food. She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone. She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves. After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas. The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.
+ Cats love this stuff. One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch. We give pouches as a treat.
+ They LOVE it, I give my kitties (Silki and Tuffy) half a pouch each as a mid day snack to keep thier bird terrorizing energy level up.I gave it 4 stars only because it's a little messy to tear open sometimes, and I don't use scissors because you have to clean them afterwards. Oh Well, they DO love it.
+ Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in fes. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health decd. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice ...
+ My finicky cats are difficult to please particularly when it comes to their food.Boy,....was I finally RELIEVED...when they chowed down on these!!!
+ My cat will eat NOTHING but Whiskas Beef in Gravy cat food. Being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing. I get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues. Its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food. Her cat is her companion through hard times.
+ I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each. For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts. They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes. This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have. There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid. <a href="http//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B2KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good. Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food.
+ Great tasting chai. Easy to desolve it in hot water. Adds zing to coffee, too. I don't like cloves or allspice and, thankfully, can't taste any in this yummy brew.
+ I love this chai...it is the best on the market. I was sick of spending $4 almost daily, so I decided to make them at home instead. BEST CHOICE EVER! I use hot water and frothed milk, sprinkle with cinnamon, and it tastes like my favorite bakery chai! Also, I highly recommend this seller...I received the chai on the next business day. Extremely satisfied customer.
+ I love Chai tea, and Big Train Chai is the best one that I have come across. The 3lb. bag is the best buy! Knowing what I would have spent at a coffee shop...5 drinks alone would cost at least $20, so I've made my money back after only 5 or so drinks. A yummy product, big quantity and saved money~I Love it!!
+ Excellent product. This is the chai used at my local coffee/tea establishments. Saves me money by making my own. These sell for $4 each when I purchase from my favorite baristas.
+ Make no mistake... Giving your dog raw foods, or dehydrated foods + rehydration, will beat all options. It is not really feasible for most people's lives and, even if it is feasible, its not easy to do at EVERY treat time as well as meal time. The Zero/G from Darford is the next best option. This includes their treats and food. My dogs LOVE these shrimp/trout treats being reviewed. At 30 calories per treat its perfect for an active adult dog and easily breaks in half for smaller dogs with less caloric requirement and, of course, for lazy dogs.This product probably should not be sub-named "With Trout and Shrimp". The first ingredient in this specific formula, mysis shrimp, is not a 'meal' and is not dry when measured. This means that after the 80% of water is taken out of the shrimp its true content would appear waaaay down the list of ingredients, possibly in the lower 25% of ingredients. The fourth ingredient, herring meal, is a legitimate measurement and gives...

+ You might think that a collection of rice bowls would taste alike. Not so here.Each bowl has it's own delightful personality.
+ my dogs love this dog food. their fur is healthier looking nicer and softer. the small bits are great for my smaller dogs.

- It is one of the waste product.
- The product doesn't work at all.
- Got a damaged one.
+ It was more than I expected
+ As expected with a natural(no conditioning) shampoo, does not leave hair very supple(not recommended for people with dry hair)
- It is not more than average & the effects are not long lasting.

- Too fruity to be handled, looks and smells absolutely like strawberry jam.

+ interface (smooth, fast, easy to navigate)
+ nifty features (voice command, auto-patching, playing games while downloading/installing them)
+ swappable hard drive
+ controller design (with the small exception of its "night light")
+ sharing ability (expand your presence in the community)
+ online experience (soundly restructured from previous online with PS3)
+ Great new controller.
+ Improved UI over the PS3's.
- cooling system (gets a bit loud)
- Sony needs to continue working on the UI and updating it over time so as to keep it streamlined.
- Launch lineup isn't that great.
- The light bar on the controller can't be turned off.
- Maybe a future system update will offer this option, but it seems to be the culprit for the batter drain.
- Use of the trackpad seems gimmicky in most game so far.
- Its like a kid's toy,doesnt hold the phone.
- The grip was loose and my cell fell twice while i was driving... Disappointed!
+ it sticks like nothing I've seen...
+ The holding power is amazing.
+ The product finish is top-notch.
- Holder will not work on dashboard or other plastic surface, only works on glass.
+ must buy everyone nice holding vaccumming,suitale for upto 5.5 inches phone

+ Easy to navigate. Good interface. Nice features for this price . Nice mobile, price worthy, good working, specified 13mp rear camera not upto the mark, fast delivery
- disappointed with touch quality and camera . Camera Quality is not as good as according to mentioned feature
- this price ,everything felt okay ,but disappointed with touch quality
+ Good Product. Product is up to the mark. Camera quality is excellent. Initially experienced battery problem but was rectified after installing Google Now launcher. No heating problem
- Sound Quality is very poor. This product processor is very slow. There is no any option, while downloading location is not asking to save it, automatically all apps are directly storing to internal SD
- Camera is very bad. its not comparable. Not a good one because the charging gets over very fast.came too about the phone after one month so cannot return the product not satisfied at all
- Phone is not charging even after changing chargers 2 times. Not able to see internal and external memory while connecting to my laptop
+ I am very happy with this mobile. Its actually working nice. Actually its working much better than expectation.
+ overall good looking and good battery.Works well. Better than other protectors in market
- loudspeaker is bit low. the headset was not working and apart from that no replacement of the product available.dont buy it
+ This Mobile is so awesome to use and it has a very good version. This is very stylish. I like this phone very much
- Rear and front camera clarity is not up to mark apart from that rest is average. great fit to your device. Thickness is great. Little fingerprint scanner is catching
+ Best mobile phone in this price and amazon service is superb. I would like to recommend this phone.
+ It's an excellent phone comparing prices and features with others. Speed for octacore processor is not that much evident but Overall a good phone for the price and delivery was smooth
- internal storage too less practical ,touch is not very bad,not that good
- the product itself isn't a good buy. The touch is bad and It hardly works
- Do Not Purchase this product. It does not fit completely near the button. Even though I tried to fix that it remains fixed until I give pressure and when I leave, it again come back to original position
- Wifi is not working. I have tried connecting to many wifi networks and it's not connecting.i think this is a major issue with phone
+ Picture Quality and Sensors are amazing.. Everything is Unique. I am telling you both the rear and front camera are gorgeous. Just the problem is that you cant zoom much.
+ Very nice and smooth operation. Clear picture by camera. Good battery back up.
- It's a very bad mobile phone. Functionality is very bad . Product is delicate. Develops crack immediately if cell falls. I have got 2 of these in last 1month and both have cracks now
- Worst phone , will never buy ,no charge ,no earphones ,phone performance also hangs too much
- Dont go for this ..performance is worst. I am disappointed after buying this and I am returning the product
+ It went through the washing machine all the way through to spin and still worked (new headphones were required). What more can I say?
+ This is the greatest mp3 player out there. i never even installed the software for song transfer. I love it!!!!
+ Very compact size/ weight is great for clipping onto workout wear. Easy to use.. great sound.. great little screen.. good battery... Love it !
- It doesn't have a LCD screen. Although you can customize the playlist, I just can't remember the order of the songs. Waste of money.
- pfft. waste of money. i loved it until my screen faded and consequentally went BLACK after 5 months rendering it USELESS.
- Maybe if these were high end rechargable niMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
- I opened this, downloaded a few files, listened for 45 minutes and then nothing. What a waste. Not worth it at any price.
- Never buy any product from rio ever, this is a horible product and I couldn't get anyone to tell me how to get it to work. I was absolutly horrible
+ This product is really versatile for my needs. I can listen to music, watch videos, and most importantly store my photos while on the go!!
- Screen died within 2 weeks had to return it. Think I will go in another direction.
- Buy this item and the right forward button "next" will not work. It is unfortunate.
- The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places. perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out. In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
- First of all, I got a white ipod. I ordered black! But other than that, it came pretty slow, and it was missing the installation disc.
- Shuffle setting isn't random, plays different order but that same diferent order every time, the headphones stink!
+ This wiffle bat is light and easy to use. Substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse. It will not hurt the horse, but will get the horse's attention
- Beware of this product. It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer. I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly. I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy.
+ Got a Gen 3 and a Gen 2 for my son and daughter. She wanted a Gen 2 since that is what her friends have. She saw the Gen 3 and changed her mind.
- When this unit works it is a great idea. Mine froze up on me and I was forced to return it.
+ It's cheaper, easy-to-use, has a screen so you can select songs/ albums, and fits more music. Oh, and it has a pretty good battery life.
- .. but in this case an inferior product. There are better ones out there with more functionality and better quality.
+ two things, is there a case for this thing you can buy anywhere? also, is it the same size as the 20 GB model? Thanks!
+ Perfect for travel/ storage when a laptop is too much. Handles my digital RAW photos easily.
+ first mp3 player for me. i am very pleased with it. easy to use and very well made. can do a lot with it for a small price.
+ tried player and very happy with results. would highly recommend this to others.
+ This drum set is awsome and affordable. It has a nice clean but deep sound, and works for any type of music. But since America now is scared of reading, It seems people are neglecting to notice that while the picture has cymbols, it has clearly printed it does not come with cymbals. 5 star though
- It did not work. From first time. I could not start, It did not charge. Pure aggrevation.
- The battery will eventually wear out. But becase of integrated battery type in this device, it is likely you will be in hard time of replacing it.
- It is so easy to break!!!
+ This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.
- Specs say 20 hours get maybe 2. Then have to turn of batter life switch and back on.
+ I have tried nearly all brands of energy bars. Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ
- I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment
+ The best ipod ever! Great size, video resolution, sound! I completely recommended it! I got it like for a month and i think is great!
+ Buy this K5 and you will be amazed how will the belt in speaker sounds and the FM radio works great.
+ Always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year
+ I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather.
+ Great product! It was exactly how it was described and I had no problems with the transaction at all. I bought this as a gift and he was very happy with it
- Have to agree with the majority of reviewers here, don't waste your time. Mine died, and customer support very unhelpful.
- The flash drive doesnt get detected at all. The customer service of CENTON doesnt respond. I wish i could get the replacement. Thanks..
+ I love this thing. It was a great value, love the arm strap so I can run with it when I use my sports head phones. Love the pink. Easy to add music directly from CD w/ o storing on computer.
+ people thunk its bad but its not its a good mp3 from a respected comuter company and it sounds great
+ This machine really makes you feel it. I like the fact that it also stretches your back which feels great. The only thing I can say is I wish it folded up for better storage but other than that, I like it.
+ i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik
+ This is a great item, liek a mini tivo for on the go people, recoreds from tv, computer, dvd directly, awesome item.....
+ Fantastic player with good software to burn CD's as well. Able to type in and search by Artist, genre and albums. Great sound quality and bass booster options. A+ product!
+ machspeed trio 1 gb mp3 player also a 1gb flashdrive i have no complaints it works great. I recommend it
- DO nOT BUY FOR BODY FAT MEASUREMEnT
+ This player has been working fine for me. I only use it for about 1 hour, M-F, on the way home from work. I had to buy new headphones because the ones that came with it hurt my ears, otherwise, no complaints.
+ This baby not only looks good its da biz i got it recently no regrets!
- What is this all about. I have not ordered this item nor do I have it. please reply
- I have sent this item back twice. Talked to rep and they said that whole inventory of ipods are messed up. They are refunded my money.
+ This tools is really really great. It helped me to overcome the problem I faced while playing guitar, specially the barre chords
- This divice freeses every now and then, it's not worth returning so i will just deal with it.
+ Scorcese's first masterpiece.
+ Director Martin Scorsese's nightmare vision of Manhattan is important, impulsive work.
+ Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. Movies don't get any better than this.
+ A masterful psychological study, the depth of which can only fully be appreciated on repeat viewings.
+ Taxi Driver is grounded in its socio-political context, yet it also touches on something more universal... how one finds purpose and identity in a collapsing capitalistic society.
+ Hanks is excellent and I applaud Spielberg for delving into some new territory.
- What's shocking here is the inanity of it all.
+ Lovely and well worth sharing with your family.
+ A crowd-pleasing and entertaining film about humanity and heart with excellent performances and competent directing from Spielberg.
+ A feel-good comedy that is very different. I highly recommend watching it!
- A handful of scenes are effective in isolation, but 'The Terminal' doesn't hold together overall.
- Discordant, unsatisfying, sometimes emotionally incoherent.
+ Showcases a fine performance from Hanks but one that gets lost while attempting to transcend a higher purpose.
+ The Terminal is a surefooted fable about what connects us as humans.
+ A rather enjoyable piece of complete and utter fluff.
+ To watch "Lives" is not just to enjoy a fabulously constructed timepiece; it's to appreciate a deft cautionary tale.
+ Not overpraised at all. This is one of the best films of our time
+ Despite the fact that parts of this film remind us of past pictures with comparable themes, the director and his actors make it immediate, gripping.
+ Works beautifully, both as a social and psychological drama and as a taut, tightly wired thriller
+ An absolutely incredible performance by ulrich muhe(gkw.7) best movie i've seen in years.
+ The scope is especially impressive given that the movie is about a society obsessively focused on the tiniest of details.
+ The Lives of Others is a powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires
+ A truly unforgettable movie
- The Lives of Others aims to flatter its audience - a quality typical for a film whose emotional posturing is only skin deep.
- Although Henckel von Donnersmarck has a number of genuinely good ideas ... the film is marred by redundancy, indecision and clumsiness.
+ Dark, twisted and beautiful, this entwines fairy-tale fantasy with war-movie horror to startling effect.
+ Ferocious and beautiful.
+ A swift and accessible entertainment, blunt in its power and exquisite in its effects
- ... for more than a couple of minutes (no matter what I did) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink. Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke. I've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
- The software on the RCA Kazoo is almost impossible for me to figure out. The RCA kazoo's Headphones also "are bad". I think it is too expensive for what its worth and i am asking you not to buy this peice of junk.
- I don't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles. It's basically just Gatorade with more sugar in it. If you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere
+ i have absolutely no complaints. super easy to use and i'm a gadget-idiot! great for running.
+ This metronome shows the different italian terms used to describe tempos. This makes it easier to know at what tempo to practice your music
+ This MP3 player is very user friendly and easy to follow directions for getting started. Also love the clip on.
- Don't buy iriver products unless you don't want customer service cuz they don't have any!
- Music loaded fine, but the mode button was broken. Therefore, the player would not play. I had to send it back.
+ Perfect Size, easy to use. FM Tuner is nice to have. For someone who doesn't need an overly abundant amount of songs on their MP3, this is great!!
- It list good specs but I wouldn't know as it doesn't work with XP home and there are noe firmware updates/ drivers for it. The companies web site is pathetic with no forums or any way to give feedback. It might make a good paper weight tho..
- This is a piece of junk with LCD display defect in the first place. Do NOT buy it.
+ This is a great product for the money. For a novice, it was easy to use. The instructions were pretty thin but it was simple to figure out. A useful tool
+ this was my grandson's present last year from his Mom and Dad. He loves it
- It plays videos, but according to the Apple website, you get two hours of video playback before your battery drains. Crash and burn.
+ Delhi belly Good service, nice and clean. Too much attention sometimes from service staff. Nice with gym inside the hotel
+ There is just one word to describe this product: amazing. I'm full satisfied with it. Just buy it with 1Mbytes (mine is 512kBytes). One last thing: the battery lasts forever
+ This is by far the BEST flash-based MP3 player I have ever used. It is incredibly user friendly. Great sound and picture with all the bells and whistles.
+ the ipod is great! it got here in good time and great shape. it has plenty of memory to hold tons of music. it is a great size to carry around and use anywhere anytime.
- The iPod is better, more popular, and more compatible. Why go against the grain. Do the right thing and go Apple.
+ battery life is great , and the SD card extention is nice you can add a 2GB card no problem.
+ Great features! probably the best pedometer out there for the money. The only reason I give 4 vice 5 stars, is that I think the one I bought for my mom (same brand and model) is slightly more accurate. A great way to track your fitness overall
+ Fast and Accurate !!!
+ Great gadget. Decent price. Lots of options. What else do you need?
+ nano sounds gr8 i m very happy with the sound i hear compared to a old mp3 player i had and also very sleek and easy to use..
- seems I may have already broke this bar - twisted it to stop it from spinning while I was doing exercise and heard a pOp now it spins all the time I use it - not happy :( I did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already
+ It went through the washing machine all the way through to spin and still worked (new headphones were required). What more can I say?
+ This is the greatest mp3 player out there. i never even installed the software for song transfer. I love it!!!!
+ Very compact size/ weight is great for clipping onto workout wear. Easy to use.. great sound.. great little screen.. good battery... Love it !

+ two things, is there a case for this thing you can buy anywhere? also, is it the same size as the 20 GB model? Thanks!
+ Perfect for travel/ storage when a laptop is too much. Handles my digital RAW photos easily.
+ first mp3 player for me. i am very pleased with it. easy to use and very well made. can do a lot with it for a small price.
+ tried player and very happy with results. would highly recommend this to others.
+ This drum set is awsome and affordable. It has a nice clean but deep sound, and works for any type of music. But since America now is scared of reading, It seems people are neglecting to notice that while the picture has cymbols, it has clearly printed it does not come with cymbals. 5 star though
- It did not work. From first time. I could not start, It did not charge. Pure aggrevation.
- The battery will eventually wear out. But becase of integrated battery type in this device, it is likely you will be in hard time of replacing it.
- It is so easy to break!!!
